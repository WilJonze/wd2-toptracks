<h2 align="center"> About </h2>

This project was completed In Additon to the normal course work required in Code Louisvilles Web Development 2 Cohort. The team had less than a month to create this full stack application and have it hosted for public use. The original goal was to practice simulating a professional workflow environment, similar to what we would see in a development job. Setting up a development branch that we would work off of until we were ready for a push to production. Issues, Pull Requests, Code Reviews, and most importantly, Communicating constantly to make sure that everyone stayed together in creating the project. However, it quickly became apparent what the potential would be, and the team was able to work hard to create excellent product.
